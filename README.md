I had gotten some help from classmates for question 10.
I used w3schools to help me with a few small things including:
-Reading files: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_files_read.asp 
-Hashsets: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_hashset.asp
-Hashmaps: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_hashmap.asp
-LinkedLists: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_linkedlist.asp
-Enums: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_enums.asp 
these were mainly to just understand how certain things i didnt understand work and also to learn some of the keywords.
